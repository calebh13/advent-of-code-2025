# Advent of Code 2025
My solutions to Advent of Code for 2025. Written in Python.

Some highlights:
- Day 1: fun with negative modulo operations and related edge cases.
- Day 2: part 1 uses some math tricks with powers of 10 and division to explicitly generate the IDs. Part 2 brute forces the more complicated IDs with a nice regex.
- Day 3: nice solution, dynamic programming-esque. Part 2 is a generalization to arbitrary numbers of batteries which felt very natural.
- Day 4: super simple 2D array searching.
- Day 5: nice use of sorting/binary search to remove duplicates and reduce time complexity. First problem I was able to use "classic" CS algorithms on.
- Day 6: part 1 was very simple. Part 2 had some slightly more interesting string traversal and using that to build a number.
- Day 7: more string traversal. I initially wanted to use a backtracking/recursive approach for part 2, but realized I could simplify that by just writing numbers to the board directly.
